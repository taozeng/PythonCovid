Many states, such as NY, are using a 7-day rolling average, of positive test percentage and/or 
number of positive cases per capita, to decide whether to apply the travel restrict for 
people coming from other states.

I would like to see a trend of these metrics so that I know whether my home state is going to
be removed from the restricted list.

I can not find such charts online, so I decided to make them by myself.
